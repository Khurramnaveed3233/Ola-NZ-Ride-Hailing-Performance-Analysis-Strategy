#  Ola NZ â€“ Rideâ€‘Hailing Performance Analysis & Strategy

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes **Olaâ€™s New Zealand rideâ€‘hailing operations** to uncover inefficiencies, revenue leaks, and customer experience gaps.  
Using **advanced SQL** (Joins, CTEs, Window Functions, Stored Procedures) and a **Power BI dashboard**, I answered 14 targeted business questions, built a **starâ€‘schema data model**, and delivered **dataâ€‘driven strategies** to improve utilization, retention, and profitability.

## ðŸ—„ Dataset & Model

**Star Schema Design**
- **Fact Tables**: `fact_bookings`, `fact_ratings`

## Key Insights & Findings

### 1. Revenue Distribution

- **Auckland** generates the highest revenue but is nearing market saturation.
- **Christchurch** underperforms despite higher marketing spend.

### 2. Cancellations

- **Wellington**â€™s cancellation rate (~18%) is nearly double Aucklandâ€™s, driven by long wait times and low driver density.
- **Hamilton** shows extreme idle time for drivers.

### 3. Demand Patterns

- Peak demand: **7â€“9 AM** and **5â€“7 PM**.
- These slots also have the highest cancellations and surge pricing complaints.

### 4. Driver Performance

- Top 10% of drivers earn **3Ã— more** than average, due to better ratings and strategic location choices.
- A small subset of drivers consistently records higher cancellations.

### 5. Vehicle Profitability

- **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** have the highest fare per km, making them the most profitable.

### 6. Customer Loyalty

- **Gold-tier** customers ride most frequently â€” key segment for retention campaigns.

### 7. Revenue Mix

- Over 50% of trips are short rides but contribute less than 25% of revenue â€” imbalance in fare structure.

### 8. Pricing & Retention

- Long trips in Wellington are underpriced compared to Auckland, reducing driver earnings.
- Christchurchâ€™s heavy promo usage does not translate into repeat customers.
